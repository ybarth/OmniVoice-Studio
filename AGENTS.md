## Project

**OmniVoice Studio**

OmniVoice Studio is an open-source, fully-local ElevenLabs alternative — a desktop app for voice cloning, voice design, video dubbing, and real-time dictation across 646 languages. It runs entirely on the user's machine (CUDA/MPS/ROCm/CPU auto-detect), with no API keys, no accounts, and no cloud dependencies. Today it's a v0.2.7 active beta with a growing user base who hit it with real workloads (50-video batches, multi-engine setups, edge-OS platforms) and report friction in GitHub Issues and Discord.

**Core Value:** **A first-run that actually works.** A user who downloads the installer (or clones the repo) should reach a working voice-cloning or dubbing output without hitting a wall — and when something does go wrong, the error or docs should tell them exactly what to do.

Everything else (new engines, fancy features) is downstream of "the thing installs and runs reliably across platforms, with the engines and pipelines users already depend on staying compatible."

### Constraints

- **Existing engine compatibility**: Users with already-installed engines (IndexTTS, CosyVoice, etc.) must not have to reinstall. Fixes touching engine code must be backward-compatible with on-disk model state.
- **Cross-platform parity**: Every fix must work on macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), Windows (x64), and Linux (AppImage + deb). No platform-only regressions; the cross-platform bug bash (PR #51) is the baseline.
- **Backward-compatible project data**: Existing `omnivoice_data/` (user voices, projects, settings) must keep working without manual migration. Any DB schema change goes through alembic with a tested upgrade path.
- **Local-first guarantee preserved**: Auto bug reporting (new addition) must be **opt-in**, must submit only to GitHub Issues (no third-party telemetry endpoint), and the app must remain fully functional with reporting disabled. No required cloud calls, accounts, or API keys.
- **Beta release cadence**: `v0.3.0` ships **once** when the complete stabilization milestone is delivered — all 7 roadmap phases done, all open install/runtime issues resolved, all community PRs reconciled, the release pipeline (`release.yml`) green end-to-end. **No incremental `v0.3.x` tags between `v0.2.7` and `v0.3.0`.** Everything merges to `main` continuously; users follow `main` for previews; users wanting stable stay on `v0.2.7`. Tag `v0.3.0` once when the milestone is complete and publish the GitHub Release with full notes. Version is secondary to issue closure ("Empty the inbox" outcome) — don't gate v1.0 on this milestone.

## Technology Stack

## Recommended Stack — Per Capability
### Capability 1 — HuggingFace Token Persistence (issue #35)
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `huggingface_hub` (already pinned transitively by `transformers>=5.3.0`) | `≥1.12.x` (latest 2026) | Auth + cache + token storage | Canonical, used by every HF library already in the stack. `HfFolder` is **superseded** in v1.x by the higher-level `login()` / `auth_list()` / `auth_switch()` API. |
| `keyring` (Python) | `≥25.x` | Optional OS-keychain backing | Only adopt if a future hardening pass wants Keychain/Credential-Manager/SecretService. **Not recommended for this milestone** — adds a native dep (`dbus`, `pywin32`) per platform with no real security win over `0600` file storage in `HF_HOME`. |
| Shell | One-liner to persist `HF_TOKEN` |
|-------|---------------------------------|
| macOS zsh (default since 10.15) | `echo 'export HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc` |
| Linux bash | `echo 'export HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc` |
| Windows PowerShell (user scope) | `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("HF_TOKEN","hf_xxx","User")` (new shells only) |
| Windows cmd | `setx HF_TOKEN "hf_xxx"` (user scope, new shells only) |
- [HF environment variables docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/package_reference/environment_variables) — HIGH confidence (official, current)
- [HF authentication API docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/package_reference/authentication) — HIGH confidence
- [Microsoft `setx` docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/setx) — HIGH confidence
### Capability 2 — In-App Structured Bug Reporting (opt-in, GitHub Issues)
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| GitHub REST API `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` | `2026-03-10` API version | Server-side issue creation | Official, stable. Requires auth. |
| **Prefilled-URL pattern** (`github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/new?title=…&body=…&labels=…`) | n/a | Zero-auth fallback | **This is the recommended primary path for v0.3.x.** No token needed, no GitHub App registration needed, user's browser opens with a prefilled form, they review and click Submit. They own the issue, the OSS project gets the report, and OmniVoice never holds a credential. |
| `gh-app-jwt` + GitHub App (Rust crate `octocrab` or Python `pygithub`) | only if we later want fully-automated submission | Programmatic posting under an app identity | **Defer to a later milestone.** Requires registering a public GitHub App, hosting a token-exchange endpoint, and managing rate-limit quotas — disproportionate for stabilization scope. |
| `platform`, `psutil`, `torch.cuda` (already in deps) | already pinned | Capture OS, CPU/GPU/VRAM info | No new deps. |
| `httpx` (already in `dev-dependencies`, promote to runtime if needed) | `≥0.28.1` | HTTP for the API call path (if/when we add auth) | Modern async-first, already used in test suite. |
- ✓ No token storage in OmniVoice → no security surface
- ✓ Opt-in by definition (user has to click Submit on github.com)
- ✓ User owns the issue → can be replied to, edited, closed by them
- ✓ Zero infra cost — no proxy, no app, no rate-limit management
- ✓ Works identically on macOS / Windows / Linux via Tauri's `shell.open`
- ✓ Survives our project being forked (just change the URL)
- OS name + version (`platform.platform()`)
- Python version (`sys.version`)
- OmniVoice version (`pyproject.toml`)
- Backend git SHA (if installed from source) or installer build ID
- CPU model, RAM (`psutil.cpu_count()`, `psutil.virtual_memory()`)
- GPU vendor/model/VRAM (`torch.cuda.get_device_name()`, `torch.cuda.mem_get_info()`, MPS detect)
- Active TTS engine + list of installed engines
- Frontend: bun version, OS shell
- Last error message + stack trace if launched from an error toast
- Audio file contents (privacy — reference samples may contain user's voice)
- File paths containing `/Users/<name>/` (strip home dir → `~/`)
- HF token, OpenAI keys, any env var matching `*TOKEN*|*KEY*|*SECRET*`
- [GitHub URL query parameters for issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-url-query) — HIGH confidence
- [sindresorhus/new-github-issue-url](https://github.com/sindresorhus/new-github-issue-url) — HIGH (widely used reference impl)
- [GitHub REST API: Create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues#create-an-issue) — HIGH confidence (for the future auto-submit path)
- [sentry-tauri](https://github.com/timfish/sentry-tauri) — reviewed, **rejected for milestone** due to local-first constraint
### Capability 3 — `uv venv` Mirror Fallback for Restricted Networks (issues #57, #60)
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `uv` (already used) | `≥0.5.x` | Python+venv bootstrap | Existing dep. |
| `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR` env var | uv `0.4.x`+ | Override python-build-standalone download URL | **Official, current.** Replaces `https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download/...` in download URL construction. No built-in fallback if mirror fails. |
| `UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE=only-system` (or CLI flag `--python-preference only-system`) | uv `0.4.x`+ | Skip the python-build-standalone download entirely; use the user's system Python | **The reliable escape hatch** when no mirror works. Requires a compatible Python `>=3.11` to already be on PATH. |
| `UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT`, `UV_HTTP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, `UV_HTTP_RETRIES` | uv `0.4.x`+ | Tune retry behavior for flaky links | Defaults are 30s / 10s / 3 — bump to 120s / 30s / 5 for restricted networks. |
# Pseudocode for the bootstrap
# Final fallback: don't download Python at all
- `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple` (Tsinghua — fastest in China)
- `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple` (Aliyun fallback)
- Russia: no major government-blessed PyPI mirror; users typically tunnel via VPN. Document this honestly rather than ship a broken default.
- [uv environment variables reference](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/) — HIGH (official)
- [uv issue #5224 — python-build-standalone mirror support](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5224) — HIGH (the feature was added)
- [uv issue #14187 — venv on Chinese network](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14187) — HIGH (confirms real user pain, no built-in fallback)
- [uv python-versions concepts](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/docs/concepts/python-versions.md) — HIGH (documents `python-preference` semantics)
- [dautovri/mirrors-china](https://github.com/dautovri/mirrors-china) — MEDIUM (community-maintained mirror list; verify each URL still works before shipping)
### Capability 4 — Supertonic-3 TTS Engine
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `supertonic` (PyPI) | `1.3.1` (latest, May 18 2026 — Phase 3 Wave 1 to verify constructor signature before bump) | Official Supertonic-3 inference SDK | Authoritative wrapper from Supertone Inc. Wraps the ONNX session orchestration so we don't have to. |
| `onnxruntime` | `≥1.17.x` (any recent) | ONNX inference runtime | Already a transitive dep of WhisperX (via CTranslate2 path is separate, but `onnxruntime` itself ships for kittentts and audioseal). Verify with `uv tree` after adding — should resolve cleanly. |
| `huggingface_hub` (already pinned) | `≥1.12.x` | Model weight download (~400 MB on first use) | Reuses existing HF token + cache infrastructure. The user's existing `HF_TOKEN` (Capability 1) works for the Supertonic model download too. |
| `numpy`, `soundfile` (already pinned) | already pinned | Audio I/O + array math | No new deps. |
- `text_encoder.onnx`
- `latent_denoiser.onnx`
- `voice_decoder.onnx`
- 44.1 kHz sample rate, 24-dim latent, 128-dim style
- ~99M parameters total
- Tokenizer: `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)` — loads from `tokenizer.json` shipped with model
- [Supertone/supertonic-3 model card](https://huggingface.co/Supertone/supertonic-3) — HIGH (official)
- [supertone-inc/supertonic GitHub](https://github.com/supertone-inc/supertonic) — HIGH (official)
- [supertonic PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/supertonic/) — HIGH (`1.3.1` confirmed 2026-05-18; same publisher, MIT, same 4 deps)
- [onnx-community/Supertonic-TTS-ONNX](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Supertonic-TTS-ONNX) — HIGH (ONNX file structure details)
### Capability 5 — Cross-Platform Documentation Tooling
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Plain Markdown in `docs/` + GitHub-rendered (current state) | n/a | Install tutorial, troubleshooting | Zero new infra. Renders inline on GitHub for issue-replies. No build step to break. |
| Existing `scripts/smoke-test.sh` + Playwright `tests/` (already in `package.json`) | already pinned | Verify install paths actually work | **This is the real solution to "docs drift."** If smoke-test exercises the install path described in docs, docs that drift will break CI. |
| **Future** (defer): Astro Starlight | `≥0.30` | Standalone docs site at `docs.omnivoice.studio` | Adopt only when docs exceed ~20 markdown files and need search/versioning. Tauri, the framework OmniVoice already depends on, uses Starlight — well-traveled choice. Material for MkDocs entered maintenance mode in November 2025 per Docsio's 2026 review — **avoid** for new docs. |
| Project | What they do |
|---------|--------------|
| **OBS Studio** | Docs at `obsproject.com/docs` (Sphinx, separate repo). Install paths in README, wiki for community-contributed. CI doesn't gate on docs drift. |
| **Audacity** | Manual at `manual.audacityteam.org` (MediaWiki). README is minimal. Install path = "use the installer." No automated sync. |
| **Tauri** | Docs at `v2.tauri.app` (Astro Starlight, separate repo `tauri-apps/tauri-docs`). README is minimal. Heavy reliance on community contributions and PR review. |
| **VS Code** | Docs at `code.visualstudio.com/docs` (separate repo, Markdown). README is minimal. Manual sync; docs team is staffed. |
- [Tauri docs (Astro Starlight)](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs) — HIGH (reference for "if we ever move off README")
- [OBS Studio docs](https://docs.obsproject.com/) — HIGH (Sphinx, separate site reference)
- [Audacity Manual](https://manual.audacityteam.org/) — HIGH (MediaWiki reference)
- [Docsio: Material for MkDocs 2026 review (maintenance mode)](https://docsio.co/blog/mkdocs-material) — MEDIUM (third-party review, but signal aligns with project's own GitHub activity)
- [Docsio: Starlight 2026 review](https://docsio.co/blog/starlight-docs) — MEDIUM
## Installation
# No new Python dependencies needed for Capabilities 1, 2, 3, 5.
# Only Capability 4 adds a runtime dep:
# Verify no regressions:
# Should show single versions of each; no duplicates.
## Alternatives Considered
| Recommended | Alternative | When to Use Alternative |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| HF token via in-app Settings → `huggingface_hub.login()` | OS keyring via `keyring` package | Only if a security hardening milestone later demands OS-native credential storage. Not worth the cross-platform native-dep cost for v0.3.x. |
| Prefilled-URL GitHub Issues | GitHub App + device flow + authenticated POST | When milestone budget can afford registering a public GitHub App and hosting a token-exchange function. Defer. |
| Prefilled-URL GitHub Issues | Sentry / `sentry-tauri` | Never — violates the "no third-party telemetry endpoint" constraint in PROJECT.md. |
| `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR` chain + `only-system` fallback | Bundle Python in the Tauri installer | Adds ~30 MB to every installer for ~5% of users. Revisit if the bootstrap is still a top complaint in v0.4. |
| In-repo Markdown docs | Astro Starlight standalone site | When docs grow past ~20 pages and need full-text search. Tauri provides a precedent if/when we get there. |
| In-repo Markdown docs | MkDocs / Material for MkDocs | **Avoid** for new sites — Material for MkDocs is in maintenance mode as of Nov 2025. |
## What NOT to Use
| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| `HfFolder.save_token()` directly | Older API; v1.x `login()` does the same plus git-credential integration and is the documented path | `huggingface_hub.login(token=val, add_to_git_credential=False)` |
| Setting `HF_TOKEN` via shell rc files as the *only* persistence mechanism | Different per OS, fragile, opaque to the user, breaks in installer-launched processes that don't source shell rc | Write to `$HF_HOME/token` via `login()`. Document env var as override only. |
| `setx` for HF token persistence | Doesn't propagate to current shell; common source of "I set it but it's empty" bug reports | `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(...,"User")` in PowerShell, or the in-app Settings field |
| PAT-based GitHub Issues posting from OmniVoice | Would require shipping or asking for a token; breaks local-first promise | Prefilled-URL pattern (user submits from their browser) |
| `sentry-tauri` for OmniVoice | Third-party telemetry endpoint — violates PROJECT.md constraint | Local-only `backend.log` rotation + opt-in prefilled-URL reporter |
| `hf_transfer` for downloads | Deprecated in favor of `hf-xet` per HF docs | Default `huggingface_hub` (uses `hf-xet` automatically when available) |
| `--python-preference managed` (default) without mirror config in restricted-network installers | Hits GitHub CDN, times out, user sees raw `uv` error | Configure `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR` + retry chain + `only-system` final fallback |
| Material for MkDocs as a *new* docs choice | Entered maintenance mode November 2025 | If docs site is eventually needed, use Astro Starlight (Tauri precedent) |
## Stack Patterns by Variant
- Set `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR` to one of the gh-proxy URLs at install time
- Set `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple` (China) or document VPN requirement (Russia)
- Fall back to `UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE=only-system` if all mirrors fail
- Increase `UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=120`, `UV_HTTP_RETRIES=5`
- Default path: in-app Settings field → `login()` → file at `$HF_HOME/token`
- Power-user path: `export HF_TOKEN=...` in shell rc (documented but not promoted)
- Both paths are read at HF library import time; env var wins on conflict
- Default path: in-app "Report a bug" → prefilled GitHub Issues URL → user reviews + submits in browser
- All optional capture toggles default ON except "include reproduction file" (privacy)
- No path posts to any URL except `github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/new` (rendered locally as a URL, opened via `shell.open`)
- `uv add supertonic` → new TTSBackend subclass in `backend/services/tts_backend.py`
- Auto-detected and added to the engine picker in Settings
- ~400 MB model download on first synthesize call, cached in `$HF_HUB_CACHE`
- Existing IndexTTS/CosyVoice/etc. installs are untouched (no shared model weights)
## Version Compatibility
| Package A | Compatible With | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| `supertonic@1.3.1` | `onnxruntime>=1.17`, `numpy>=1.24`, `huggingface_hub>=0.20` | All deps already satisfied transitively by current `pyproject.toml`. |
| `huggingface_hub>=1.12` | `transformers>=5.3.0` (current pin) | `HfFolder` retained as deprecated alias; `login()`/`get_token()` are the canonical APIs. |
| `uv>=0.5` | `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR`, `UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE` | Both env vars stable since uv 0.4.x. |
| Tauri v2 + `@tauri-apps/api/shell` | `shell.open()` for the prefilled-URL pattern | Already in the desktop app; no new permission needed beyond what the existing "open external link" plugin grants. |

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd-quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
